# PWM_Shift_Register
Self Project


This project involves the design and implementation of a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) generator using Verilog, integrated with a shift register to manage serial-to-parallel data conversion. The PWM generator produces PWM signals with varying duty cycles, allowing for efficient and flexible digital signal control. The duty cycles are dynamically assigned from an array of predefined values, enabling precise adjustments to the output signal.

Overall, this project showcases the application of digital design principles in creating a versatile PWM generator, highlighting skills in Verilog programming, modular design, and functional verification.
